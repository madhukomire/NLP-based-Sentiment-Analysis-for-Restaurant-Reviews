# NLP-based-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Restaurant-Reviews
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to automate the sentiment analysis of customer reviews for restaurants. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative, providing actionable insights to help businesses improve customer experience and service quality.

## Features
- Sentiment classification of restaurant reviews (positive/negative)
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and other methods
- Machine learning model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Visualization of sentiment distribution

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK/Spacy for NLP
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

## Getting Started
